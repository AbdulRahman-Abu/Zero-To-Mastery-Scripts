TERNARY OPERATORS

function isUserValid(bool) {
  return bool;
};

var answer = isUserValid(true) ? "You can enter" : "Access Denied";

The above is ternary operator. The ternary operator above and the below function will give same answers when called
OR

function condition() {
  if (isUserValid) {
    return "You can enter";
  } else
    { 
      return "Access Denied";
 }
};


SWITCH STATEMENT.
I sincerely do not understand this SWITCH statement

 function moveCommand(direction) {
        var whatHappens;
        switch(direction) {
            case "forward":
                whatHappens = "you encouter a monster";
                break;
            case "back":
                whatHappens = "you arrived home";
                break;
            case "right":
                whatHappens = "you found a river";
                break;
            case "left":
                whatHappens = "you run into a troll";
                break;
            default:
                    whatHappens = "please enter a valid direction";
                    break;
        }
        return whatHappens;
    }


moveCommand("forward");

window.moveCommand("back");
